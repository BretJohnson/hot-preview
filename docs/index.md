# Hot Preview Documentation

Hot Preview lets you easily work on pages and controls in your app in isolation, making UI development and testing faster and more efficient for both humans and AI agents.

Previews are similar to stories in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for JavaScript and Previews in [SwiftUI/Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/previewing-your-apps-interface-in-xcode) and [Jetpack Compose/Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling/previews) â€” but for .NET UI.
