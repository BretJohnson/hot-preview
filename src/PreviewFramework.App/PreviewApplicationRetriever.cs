    ///   experience, it must include the platform specified PreviewFramework assembly (e.g. PreviewFramework.Maui)
    ///   in addition to the PreviewFramework assembly. The platform assembly is discovered here, searching for any
    ///   assembly in the app with the [PreviewApplication] assembly attribute, used to specify the platform specific
    ///   PreviewApplication subclass. Note that 3rd party UI frameworks are supported here too - the platform assembly
    ///   need not be Microsoft authored, it just needs to have the [PreviewApplication] assembly attribute.
    ///
    ///   2. If app/library doesn't care about supporting in-app example UI or otherwise customizing the example experience,
    ///   it can just included the PreviewFramework assembly (this one) and still decorate example methods with
    ///   [Preview]. Normally libraries would do this, especially libraries that want to avoid platform dependencies. In this case,
    ///   null is returned - there's no PreviewApplication platform provider and VS can use fallback code in the tap (present for
    ///   some platforms but not all) to do the navigation.
